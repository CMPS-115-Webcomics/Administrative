CMPS 115 Style Guide


Frontend (Angular, Typescript)

We will be following Angular's style guide. Please see https://angular.io/guide/styleguide
Also be sure to install the TS Lint plugin for your IDE https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint


Backend (Javascript)

We will follow the same general principles as the frontend guide (eg single responsibility policy, variable naming conventions).

In addition, for javascript:
1. Always use const or let not var
2. Always use === instead of ==
3. Always include semicolons
4. For asynchronous constructs, try to use async/await when possible. When that fails, use promises. Only use callbacks if no other
   method is available.


File Structure and Naming Conventions

For all file-related conventions, we will be following Angular's style guide. Please refer to https://angular.io/guide/styleguide
for further information.
