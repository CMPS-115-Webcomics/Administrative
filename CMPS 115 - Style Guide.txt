CMPS 115 Style Guide


Frontend (Angular, Typescript)


See https://angular.io/guide/styleguide
Also be sure to instal the TS Lint plugin for your IDE https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint




Backend (Javascript)
Follow the same general principles as the frontend guide (eg single responsibility policy, variable naming conventions).


In addition for javascript
1. Always use const or let not var
2. Always use === not ==
3. Always include semicolons
4. For asynchronous constructs try to use async/await when possible, when that fails use promises, only use callbacks if no other method is available.
5.
